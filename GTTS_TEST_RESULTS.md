## 🎯 Your Original Voice

**British Female (Sophia Sterling)** is your original voice - the one you said was "much more natural/human."

**To use it (default)**:
```bash
python3 -m src.cli.main create "Creations/your_script.txt" "your_music.mp3" -o my_podcast
```

This uses `config.yaml` which already has British female as default!

## 🔄 How to Switch Accents

```bash
# British (your favorite) ⭐

## 🏆 Bottom Line

**You were right!** The gTTS British female voice is:
- ✅ More natural than Coqui (free male voices)
- ✅ More natural than pyttsx3
- ✅ Completely free
- ✅ Already configured as default

**For female voices, gTTS is your best free option.** 🎯

The only limitation is it's **female-only**. If you ever need a truly natural male voice, you'll need **ElevenLabs** (premium), but for female voices, **stick with gTTS!**
