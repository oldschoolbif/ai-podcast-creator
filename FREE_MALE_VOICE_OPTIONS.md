# üéôÔ∏è Free Male Voice Options - The Reality

## ‚ö†Ô∏è The Truth About Free Male TTS

### ‚ùå **gTTS (What you're using)**
- **Only has female voices**
- The `tld` parameter (co.uk, com, etc.) changes **accent** not **gender**
- ‚úÖ Very natural quality
- ‚ùå No male option at all

### Why All Your Demos Sounded Identical:
**Caching bug!** The cache key didn't include the accent parameter, so it reused the same audio file.

**‚úÖ FIXED NOW** - I updated the cache key to include voice parameters.

## üéØ **Reality Check: Free Natural Male Voices**

### The Honest Situation:

| Option | Quality | Truly Free? | Status |
|--------|---------|-------------|--------|
| **gTTS** | 9/10 ‚≠ê | ‚úÖ Yes | ‚ùå **Female only** |
| **Coqui TTS** | 7/10 | ‚úÖ Yes | ‚úÖ Has males (you said "obviously generated") |
| **pyttsx3/espeak** | 3/10 | ‚úÖ Yes | ‚úÖ Has males (you said "terrible, 1980s computer") |
| **Edge TTS** | 9/10 | ‚ö†Ô∏è Was free | ‚ùå **Microsoft blocked it** (401 errors) |

## üí¨ Let's Be Real

**My advice**:
1. **Try ElevenLabs free tier** (seriously, it's amazing)

## üéµ What Got Fixed

**Cache Bug**: ‚úÖ **FIXED!**
- Problem: All gTTS accents sounded identical
- Cause: Cache key didn't include accent parameter
- Fix: Updated `_get_cache_key()` to include `gtts_tld`
- Result: Different accents now generate different audio

**You can now properly test**:
- British female (Sophia)
- American female (Madison)
- Australian female (Olivia)
- Irish female (Siobhan)

They WILL sound different now! The cache was the issue.
