 Narration
 Today we are talking about a builder who did something few ever try: he built a working
 healthcare AI ecosystem from scratch, locally, privately, and with zero licensing costs. His
 name is Dean Pipes, and his project, Exponis, was not just a proof of concept. It was a
 manifesto in code.
 Narration
 Dean's approach to technology was human at its core. He saw healthcare software not as a
 product, but as a public utility: safe, observable, and open to improvement. Privacy was not a
 feature; it was a right. So he designed systems that could run locally, where every action was
 traceable, every message auditable, and every patient protected.
 Narration
 In under half a day, Dean built Exponis-Local, a GPU-accelerated, RAG-powered AI platform
 that understood patient history, enforced content guardrails, and spoke securely through
 speech integration. It ran on open-source components, cost nothing to operate, and required
 no external servers. A living proof that healthcare AI can be ethical, performant, and
 accessible.
 Narration
 But Exponis was more than code: it was a philosophy of engineering, composable,
 observable, and defensible. Dean combined speed with seriousness, merging modern
 cloud-native patterns with patient safety. Think systems mind, indie shipping speed,
 infrastructure taste, and full-stack pragmatism, grounded in healthcare's real-world demands.
 Narration
 He understood that technology moves people only when it respects them. His audit logs were
 not just compliance; they were accountability. His local-first stance was sovereignty. And his
 architectures were blueprints for a more humane digital future.
 Narration
He leaves behind more than repositories: he leaves behind a pattern language. Build fast,
 with guardrails. Automate, but never abdicate responsibility. Innovate, but never at the cost of
 trust.
 Outro
 If you are building something bold and need an architect who still loves to build, Dean is open
 to new projects. You can reach him on LinkedIn. [Music fades out
