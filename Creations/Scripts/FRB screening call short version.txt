DEAN (narrating):
I had a quick, thirty-minute call with the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago — and it turned out to be a fire-hose download.

There are twelve regional banks, each independent, with Chicago’s Seventh District focused on the Midwest. Most IT roles fall under National, Local, or Financial Services—but this one’s different.

It sits inside the Research Division—a small, embedded team supporting economists and even the executive leadership. Three people today: two systems analysts and one security lead. They’re reducing on-prem systems, moving workloads to the cloud, and building a data-driven environment for policy research.

The Senior Solution Architect role I’m pursuing would design those solutions end-to-end—ninety percent focused on building, not support.

Ken, the hiring manager, leads the RPPE division—Research, Policy, and Public Economics—and collaborates across the broader Federal Reserve System.

The process is structured but fast: a technical discussion, a culture fit round, then executive interviews. The role’s exempt from the federal hiring freeze, on-site most of the week but flexible for personal or hybrid days.

Walking away from that call, I realized this isn’t just an IT job. It’s a chance to modernize how economic policy is shaped and delivered—and that’s exactly the kind of mission I want to build for...except it is onsite 4 days a week. Ugghhh.
