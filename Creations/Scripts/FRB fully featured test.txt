[Intro music: soft piano + light synth pulse, -12dB, fade in 2s → underlay for 5s]

DEAN (steady, measured tone):
(beat)
I had a quick, thirty-minute call with the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago — and it turned into a fire hose of insight.
[pause 1s]

There are twelve regional banks in the Federal Reserve System, each independent.
[pause 0.5s]
Chicago covers the Seventh District — the industrial heart of America.
[pause 0.5s]
Most tech roles fall under National IT, Local IT, or Financial Services.
(beat)
But this one? It’s different.
[pause 0.75s]

[Subtle underscore resumes — low synth pulse, slight reverb]

It sits inside the Research Division — a small, embedded team supporting economists and even the executive leadership.
[pause 0.5s]
Right now, there are just three people: two systems analysts and one focused on security.
They’re leading the move to the cloud — reducing on-prem systems and building a data-driven platform for policy research.
[pause 0.75s]

[Layer in faint ticking hi-hat / data texture for 3s, fade out]

The Senior Solution Architect role I’m pursuing?
Ninety percent focused on building — not support.
Designing solutions end-to-end, in AWS and Azure, while enabling some of the smartest economists in the country.
[pause 1s]

Ken — the hiring manager — leads the Research, Policy, and Public Economics division and works across the broader Federal Reserve System.
The process ahead is structured but fast: a technical interview, culture round, then executive conversations.
[pause 0.5s]
The position’s exempt from the federal hiring freeze, mostly on-site but flexible when it counts.
[pause 1s]

[Fade up soft strings + light heartbeat bass, +2dB over bed for emotional lift]

Walking away from that call, I realized — this isn’t just an IT job.
(beat)
It’s a chance to modernize how economic policy is shaped and delivered.
(beat)
And that’s exactly the kind of mission I want to build for, except, I want to be remote for most work.

[Music fade out — 3s, end clean]
