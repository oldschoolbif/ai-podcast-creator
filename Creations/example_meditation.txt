# Five Minute Meditation - Finding Peace

[MUSIC: very soft, calming, meditation sounds]

Welcome. Find a comfortable position, close your eyes if you wish, and take a deep breath in... and out.

[MUSIC: ambient, peaceful, flowing]

Let's begin by bringing our attention to the breath. Notice the natural rhythm of your breathing. In... and out. There's nothing you need to change, simply observe.

Feel the air entering your nostrils, cool and fresh. Feel it leaving, warm and gentle. Each breath is an anchor, bringing you into this present moment.

[MUSIC: very subtle, almost silent background]

Now, expand your awareness to your entire body. Notice any sensationsâ€”perhaps the feeling of your hands resting, or your feet on the ground. Simply notice, without judgment.

If thoughts arise, that's perfectly natural. Acknowledge them like clouds passing in the sky, and gently return your attention to your breath.

[MUSIC: extremely soft, peaceful]

You are here. You are present. You are exactly where you need to be.

Take one more deep breath... and when you're ready, slowly open your eyes.

[MUSIC: gentle fade to silence]

Thank you for practicing with me today.
