# ✅ Video Compatibility Issue - FIXED!

## 🎯 Problem: Codec Errors on Windows

You were getting codec errors when trying to play the MP4 videos in Windows Media Player.

**Root cause**: Videos were using H.264 "high" profile which requires specific codecs.

---

## ✅ Solution Applied

### 1. Re-encoded Your Demo Videos ⭐

**New compatible versions created**:
- `D:\demo_british_female_compatible.mp4` ✅
- `D:\demo_american_female_compatible.mp4` ✅
- `D:\demo_australian_female_compatible.mp4` ✅
- `D:\demo_irish_female_compatible.mp4` ✅

**These will play on ANY Windows player** (including Windows Media Player)!

### 2. Updated All Future Videos

**All new videos will now use**:
- **H.264 Baseline Profile** (maximum compatibility)
- **Level 3.0** (universal playback)
- **AAC audio** (standard audio codec)
- **yuv420p pixel format** (standard color space)
- **FastStart flag** (web-optimized, instant playback)

**Changes made to**:
- ✅ `config.yaml` (main config)
- ✅ `config_gtts_british.yaml`
- ✅ `config_gtts_american.yaml`
- ✅ `config_gtts_australian.yaml`
- ✅ `config_gtts_irish.yaml`
- ✅ `src/core/video_composer.py` (video generation code)
