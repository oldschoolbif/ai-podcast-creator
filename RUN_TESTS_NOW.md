# 🚀 RUN TESTS NOW - Quick Test Execution Guide

**You asked to test everything from the start. Here's your action plan!**

---

## ⚡ Quick Test (10 minutes) - START HERE

**Open PowerShell/Terminal and run these commands:**

### 1. Navigate to Project
```powershell
cd d:\dev\AI_Podcast_Creator
```

### 2. Activate Virtual Environment
```powershell
venv\Scripts\activate
```

You should see `(venv)` in your prompt.

### 3. Run GPU Check
```powershell
python check_gpu.py
```

**What to look for:**
- ✅ Shows your GPU (RTX 4060)
- ✅ Shows CUDA available
- ✅ Shows 8.0 GB VRAM
- ✅ Says "GPU is ready"

**If it fails:** Check NVIDIA drivers, reinstall PyTorch

---

### 4. Run Bug Fixes
```powershell
python fix_bugs.py
```

**What to look for:**
- ✅ Creates .gitkeep files
- ✅ Creates .gitattributes
- ✅ Fixes temp cleanup
- ✅ Creates audio validator

---

### 5. Run Comprehensive Test
```powershell
python test_complete_setup.py
```

**What to look for:**
- ✅ All core tests pass
- ✅ Python 3.10+ detected
- ✅ PyTorch installed
- ✅ GPU detected
- ✅ Dependencies OK
- ✅ Directory structure OK
- ✅ Config file valid

**Expected:** "CORE FUNCTIONALITY: READY"

---

### 6. Test Basic Generation (CPU Mode - 2-5 min)
```powershell
python -m src.cli.main create Creations/example_welcome.txt --preview
```

**What to look for:**
- ✅ Process starts
- ✅ Shows progress
- ✅ Creates output in data/outputs/
- ✅ Takes 2-5 minutes (CPU mode is slower)

**Output file:** Check `data\outputs\` for your generated podcast!

---

### 7. Install GPU Packages (5-10 min)
```powershell
pip install TTS audiocraft
```

**What to look for:**
- ✅ Installations complete without errors
- ✅ May take 5-10 minutes to download

---

### 8. Enable GPU in Config

**Edit `config.yaml`:**

Find this section:
```yaml
tts:
  engine: "gtts"  # Change this line
```

Change to:
```yaml
tts:
  engine: "coqui"  # Changed for GPU
```

**Save the file.**

---

### 9. Test GPU Generation (First run: 10 min, downloads models)
```powershell
python -m src.cli.main create Creations/example_welcome.txt --preview
```

**What to look for:**
- ✅ First run downloads models (~2-3 GB, 5-10 min)
- ✅ Subsequent runs are MUCH faster (20-40 seconds)
- ✅ Better voice quality (natural, not robotic)

**Compare times:**
- CPU mode (step 6): ___ minutes
- GPU mode (step 9): ___ seconds
- Should be ~5-10x faster!

---

### 10. Check GPU Usage

**While step 9 is running, open another PowerShell window:**
```powershell
nvidia-smi
```

**What to look for:**
- ✅ GPU utilization at 80-100%
- ✅ Memory used: 2-3 GB for TTS
- ✅ Python process shown in GPU list

## 🐛 If Something Fails

### GPU Not Detected
```powershell
# Check drivers
nvidia-smi

# If nvidia-smi fails, install drivers:
# https://www.nvidia.com/download/index.aspx

# Reinstall PyTorch with CUDA
pip uninstall torch torchvision torchaudio
pip install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu118
```

### Import Errors
```powershell
# Reinstall dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Generation Fails
```powershell
# Check config file
python -c "import yaml; print(yaml.safe_load(open('config.yaml')))"

# Check module imports
python -c "from src.cli import main; print('CLI OK')"
```

---

## 📝 Detailed Testing (Optional)

**If you want comprehensive testing, use:**

```powershell
# Printable checklist with all tests
notepad TESTING_CHECKLIST.md
```

This has 14 detailed test sections you can work through.

## 🎬 Demo Test Script

**Want to test with a custom script? Create this:**

**File:** `Creations/quick_test.txt`

```
[SPEAKER: Host]
Hello! This is a quick test of AI Podcast Creator.

I'm testing the GPU-accelerated voice generation.

This should sound natural and clear.

[MUSIC: upbeat background music]

If you hear music, then music generation is working too!

[END]
```

**Then generate:**
```powershell
python -m src.cli.main create Creations/quick_test.txt
```
