# Quick Test Instructions

## 🚀 Run Tests NOW

Since the terminal isn't showing output directly, use this script:

```powershell
cd d:\dev\AI_Podcast_Creator
.\setup_and_test.ps1
```

This script will:
1. ✅ Check virtual environment
2. ✅ Activate venv
3. ✅ Install test dependencies
4. ✅ Run smoke tests
5. ✅ Save results to `test_results.txt`

---

## 📄 View Results

After running, check the file:
```powershell
type test_results.txt
```

Or open in notepad:
```powershell
notepad test_results.txt
```

---

## 🔧 If Script Fails

### Issue: Execution Policy
```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser
```

### Issue: Virtual Environment Not Found
```powershell
# Create venv
python -m venv venv

# Activate
.\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -r requirements-test.txt
```

### Manual Testing
```powershell
# Activate venv
.\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1

# Install tests
pip install -r requirements-test.txt

# Run tests
python -m pytest -v tests/

# Or use the runner
.\run_tests.ps1
```

## ✅ What to Expect

**Success looks like:**
```
==================== test session starts ====================
collected 25 items

tests/integration/test_pipeline.py::TestSmokeTests::test_all_modules_import PASSED
tests/unit/test_gpu_utils.py::TestGPUManager::test_init_without_gpu PASSED
...

==================== 25 passed in 5.23s ====================
```

**If some fail:**
- That's OK! It helps us identify issues
- Copy the error messages
- We'll fix them together

## 🎯 Current Status

I've created the complete test framework but can't run it directly due to terminal limitations.

**You have:**
- ✅ pytest framework configured
- ✅ 30+ tests written
- ✅ Test runners created
- ✅ CI/CD configured
- ✅ Full documentation

**You need to:**
- Run `.\setup_and_test.ps1`
- Check `test_results.txt`
- Report back what you see

---

## 📞 Report Back

After running, tell me:
1. Did the script complete? ✅/❌
2. What's in test_results.txt?
3. How many tests passed/failed?
4. Any error messages?

Then we'll address any issues! 🚀
