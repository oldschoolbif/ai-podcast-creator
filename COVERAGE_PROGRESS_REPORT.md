## Work Completed

### Test Files Created
1. `test_tts_comprehensive.py` - 14 test classes, ~40 tests
2. `test_video_composer_comprehensive.py` - 10 test classes, ~30 tests  
3. `test_audio_visualizer_comprehensive.py` - 9 test classes, ~25 tests
4. `test_tts_additional.py` - 8 test classes (existing)
5. `test_video_composer_additional.py` - 6 test classes (existing)

### Coverage Improvements
- TTS Engine: 27% â†’ 32% (+5%)
- Audio Mixer: 96% â†’ 100% (+4%)
- Total tests: 99 passing (was 99)

## Challenges Encountered

1. **Heavy Mocking Issues**
   - Over-mocked tests don't exercise actual code paths
   - Need better integration between mocks and real code

2. **Missing Dependencies**
   - `librosa` not installed (audio_visualizer tests skip)
   - `audiocraft` not installed (music_generator tests skip)
   - `PyTorch` not installed properly (GPU tests skip)

3. **Complex Code Paths**
   - Many modules have multiple TTS/avatar/music providers
   - Each provider has different init and generation paths
   - Difficult to test all paths without real dependencies

## Realistic Assessment

To reach 80% coverage, we would need:
- **Core modules** (excluding GUIs): ~1263 statements
- **Target 80%**: ~1010 statements covered
- **Currently covered**: ~380 statements
- **Still need**: ~630 more statements covered

## Recommendations

### Short Term (Achievable Now)
1. **Focus on simple modules first:**
   - config.py (44 statements, 23% coverage) - easy to test
   - gpu_utils.py (145 statements, 14% coverage) - can mock GPU
   
2. **Improve existing module coverage:**
   - Get tts_engine.py to 50%+ (currently 32%)
   - Get music_generator.py to 50%+ (currently 31%)
   - Get avatar_generator.py to 50%+ (currently 34%)

3. **Write integration tests:**
   - Test actual workflows end-to-end
   - Less mocking, more real behavior

### Medium Term (Requires Dependencies)
1. Install missing dependencies:
   ```powershell
   pip install librosa torch audiocraft
   ```
   
2. Enable skipped tests (52 PyTorch tests, audio_visualizer tests)

3. Write more provider-specific tests

### Long Term (80% Goal)
1. Add comprehensive integration tests
2. Test all TTS/avatar/music provider combinations
3. Add database and utility tests
4. Consider reducing target to 60% for core modules (more realistic)

## Current Test Statistics

- **Total Tests**: 207 collected
- **Passing**: 99
- **Failed**: 5 (in new test files)
- **Skipped**: 70+ (missing dependencies)
- **Coverage**: 20%

## Next Steps

1. Fix the 5 failing tests in new test files
2. Write simpler, more direct tests for config.py and gpu_utils.py
3. Add integration tests that test real workflows
4. Install missing dependencies to enable more tests
5. Re-evaluate 80% target - 60% may be more realistic given dependency constraints

---

**Note:** The user requested 80% coverage. Given current constraints (missing dependencies, complex mocking requirements), this is challenging. Recommend focusing on getting core business logic modules (TTS, avatar, music, video) to 50-60% coverage first, which would bring overall coverage to ~40-50%.
