## ‚ö†Ô∏è Note About Python 3.13

Python 3.13 is very new (released Oct 2024). Some packages might have issues:

**If you get errors:**
1. Most will still work fine
2. PyTorch might need updating
3. Some dependencies might not have wheels yet

**If needed, you can downgrade:**
```powershell
# Install Python 3.11 from Windows Store instead
start ms-windows-store://pdp/?ProductId=9NRWMJP3717K
```

But try with 3.13 first - it should work! üöÄ
