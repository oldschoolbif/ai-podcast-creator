## 🚀 How to Improve Coverage

### 1. Run Current Tests with Coverage Report:

```powershell
cd d:\dev\AI_Podcast_Creator
.\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1

# Generate coverage report
python -m pytest --cov=src --cov-report=html --cov-report=term tests/

# View detailed HTML report
start htmlcov/index.html
```

### 2. Add More Unit Tests:

**Example: TTS Engine Tests**
Create `tests/unit/test_tts_engine.py`:
```python
import pytest
from src.core.tts_engine import TTSEngine

class TestTTSEngine:
    def test_init(self, test_config):
        engine = TTSEngine(test_config)
        assert engine is not None
    
    @pytest.mark.network
    def test_generate_basic(self, test_config):
        engine = TTSEngine(test_config)
        audio = engine.generate("Test text")
        assert audio.exists()
```

### 3. Focus on Critical Paths First:

**High Priority (Core Functionality):**
1. Script parsing
2. TTS generation  
3. Audio mixing
4. Basic pipeline

**Medium Priority (Features):**
1. Music generation
2. Video composition
3. Configuration

**Lower Priority (Nice to Have):**
1. GUI components
2. CLI commands
3. Visualizations

## 📊 Industry Standards

### Coverage Targets:
- **Critical Code:** 90-100% (script parser, TTS, audio mixer)
- **Important Code:** 80-90% (music, video, pipeline)
- **Support Code:** 60-80% (CLI, config, utils)
- **GUI Code:** 40-60% (harder to test, less critical)
- **Overall Target:** 70-80%

### Current Status:
- **Current:** 1% (baseline)
- **Short-term goal:** 30% (core modules)
- **Mid-term goal:** 50% (integration)
- **Long-term goal:** 80% (comprehensive)

## 💡 Why Coverage is Low

### Reasons:
1. **Framework just created** - Tests were written for demonstration
2. **Focus was on setup** - Infrastructure over tests
3. **Complex codebase** - 1,875 statements to cover
4. **Real tests need dependencies** - GPU, internet, models

### What This Means:
- ✅ **Framework is ready** - Can add tests anytime
- ✅ **Infrastructure works** - Pytest, coverage, CI/CD configured
- ⚠️ **Tests needed** - Ongoing work to improve coverage
- ✅ **Normal for new QA** - Coverage improves over time

---

## 🎯 Quick Wins for Coverage

### Easy Tests to Add (1-2 hours):

1. **Config Tests:**
   ```python
   def test_config_loads():
       config = load_config('config.yaml')
       assert 'tts' in config
   ```

2. **Parser Tests:**
   ```python
   def test_parse_music_cues():
       parser = ScriptParser(config)
       result = parser.parse("[MUSIC: test]")
       assert len(result['music_cues']) > 0
   ```

3. **GPU Utils Tests:**
   ```python
   def test_get_device():
       device = get_device()
       assert device in ['cpu', 'cuda']
   ```

**Adding these → 10-15% coverage increase**

## 📝 Action Plan

### This Week:
1. Run coverage report: `start htmlcov/index.html`
2. Review which lines are tested
3. Pick one module (suggest: `audio_mixer.py`)
4. Write 5-10 tests for it
5. Re-run coverage → should see improvement!

### This Month:
1. Achieve 30% coverage (core modules)
2. Add integration tests
3. Set up pre-commit hooks
4. Monitor coverage in CI/CD

### Long Term:
1. Maintain 80% coverage
2. Add tests for new features
3. Regular coverage reviews
4. Performance testing
