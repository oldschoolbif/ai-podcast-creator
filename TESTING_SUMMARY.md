## 📋 Testing Plan

### Phase 1: Initial Verification (5 min) - **USER MUST DO THIS**
```powershell
cd d:\dev\AI_Podcast_Creator
venv\Scripts\activate
python check_gpu.py
python fix_bugs.py
python test_complete_setup.py
```

**Expected Results:**
- ✅ GPU detected (RTX 4060, 8GB)
- ✅ Bugs fixed
- ✅ 10/12 tests pass
- ✅ "CORE FUNCTIONALITY: READY"

---

### Phase 2: Basic Generation (5 min) - **USER MUST DO THIS**
```powershell
python -m src.cli.main create Creations/example_welcome.txt --preview
```

**Expected Results:**
- ✅ Takes 2-5 minutes (CPU mode)
- ✅ Creates output in data/outputs/
- ✅ Audio is clear and understandable
- ✅ Baseline performance measured

---

### Phase 3: GPU Setup (10 min) - **USER MUST DO THIS**
```powershell
pip install TTS audiocraft
```

**Edit config.yaml:**
```yaml
tts:
  engine: "coqui"  # Changed from "gtts"
```

**Expected Results:**
- ✅ Packages install successfully
- ✅ Config updated correctly
- ✅ Ready for GPU testing

---

### Phase 4: GPU Testing (10 min first run) - **USER MUST DO THIS**
```powershell
python -m src.cli.main create Creations/example_welcome.txt --preview
```

**Expected Results:**
- ✅ First run downloads models (5-10 min)
- ✅ Subsequent runs: 20-40 seconds
- ✅ 5-10x faster than CPU
- ✅ Better voice quality

**Monitor GPU:**
```powershell
nvidia-smi  # In another window
```
- ✅ GPU utilization 80-100%
- ✅ 2-3GB VRAM used

---

### Phase 5: Performance Validation - **USER MUST DO THIS**
```powershell
# Generate same file twice
python -m src.cli.main create Creations/example_welcome.txt --preview
python -m src.cli.main create Creations/example_welcome.txt --preview
```

**Compare:**
- CPU time (Phase 2): ___ minutes
- GPU time (Phase 4): ___ seconds
- Speedup: ___x

**Target:** 10x faster (600 seconds → 60 seconds)

## 🚨 Known Limitations

### What I Cannot Test From Here:
1. **Terminal output** - Terminal not showing output in current session
2. **Model downloads** - Requires internet and takes time
3. **GPU performance** - Need actual GPU hardware
4. **User environment** - System-specific issues
5. **Real-time execution** - Need user to run commands

### Workarounds:
1. **You run commands directly** in PowerShell ✅
2. **You report results** back to me ✅
3. **I fix any issues** you encounter ✅
4. **We iterate** until everything works ✅

## 🎬 Simple Test Commands

**Copy/paste these in order:**

```powershell
# 1. Navigate
cd d:\dev\AI_Podcast_Creator

# 2. Activate venv
venv\Scripts\activate

# 3. Check GPU
python check_gpu.py

# 4. Fix bugs
python fix_bugs.py

# 5. Test setup
python test_complete_setup.py

# 6. Generate (CPU)
python -m src.cli.main create Creations/example_welcome.txt --preview

# --- STOP HERE AND REPORT RESULTS ---

# 7. Install GPU (after step 6 works)
pip install TTS audiocraft

# 8. Edit config.yaml (manual)
#    Change: engine: "gtts" → engine: "coqui"

# 9. Generate (GPU - first time, slow)
python -m src.cli.main create Creations/example_welcome.txt --preview

# 10. Generate (GPU - second time, fast!)
python -m src.cli.main create Creations/example_welcome.txt --preview

# --- REPORT TIMES FOR STEPS 6, 9, AND 10 ---
```
